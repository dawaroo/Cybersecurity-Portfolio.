# Package Management and Security Tools

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how Linux package management is used to install, remove, and maintain security monitoring tools on a Linux system.

The objective of this investigation is to show how proper package management supports security operations by ensuring that critical tools such as intrusion detection systems and packet capture utilities are correctly installed, updated, and maintained.

## Tools Installed
- Suricata (IDS/IPS)
- tcpdump (packet capture and traffic analysis)

## Investigation Objective
- Verify the availability of the package manager
- Install and remove security tools using APT
- Reinstall tools to ensure integrity and proper configuration
- Demonstrate safe and controlled package management practices

## Security Impact
Improper package management can result in outdated, misconfigured, or missing security tools, reducing an organization’s ability to detect and respond to threats.

Using a trusted package manager ensures that security tools remain up to date, consistent, and reliable, supporting effective monitoring and incident response.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Linux package management (APT)
- Security tool lifecycle management
- IDS/IPS and packet capture concepts
- Secure system maintenance practices
