# Investigation Evidence & Findings

## User Account Findings
- Newly added user accounts were identified through user report file analysis
- Deleted user accounts were confirmed using archived user records
- Department-level user assignments were validated through pattern matching

## Access & Security Observations
- Multiple authentication-related errors were identified in server logs
- Repeated unauthorized access messages may indicate credential misuse or brute-force attempts
- Log analysis highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of authentication activity

## Analyst Notes
This investigation demonstrates how basic Linux command-line tools can be leveraged to audit user accounts and review access-related data without requiring administrative privileges.

The techniques applied in this project reflect real-world responsibilities of entry-level SOC analysts and IT security professionals, where auditing, monitoring, and reporting are key tasks.
