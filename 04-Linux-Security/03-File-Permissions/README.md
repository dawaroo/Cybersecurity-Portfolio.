# File Permissions and Authorization

## Description
This project demonstrates how Linux file and directory permissions are reviewed and modified to enforce proper authorization and prevent unauthorized access. The activity focuses on identifying overly permissive files, correcting access rights, and applying the principle of least privilege.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Linux permission analysis (`ls -l`)
- Understanding of user, group, and other permissions
- Applying least privilege using `chmod`
- Securing hidden files and directories
- Authorization and access control fundamentals

## Security Impact
Improper file permissions can allow unauthorized modification or disclosure of sensitive data. Enforcing least privilege at the file and directory level reduces the risk of accidental exposure and limits the impact of compromised user accounts.
