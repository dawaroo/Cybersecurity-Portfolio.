## Investigation Objective
The objective of this investigation is to identify files with overly permissive access and remove unauthorized permissions to ensure only approved users can access sensitive data.

## Findings
During the review, files were identified with permissions that allowed access beyond the intended users or groups. Excessive permissions increase the risk of unauthorized data access or modification.

## Security Impact
Improper file permissions can lead to data exposure, unauthorized changes, or privilege abuse. Enforcing least privilege reduces the attack surface and limits potential damage if a user account is compromised.
