# Incident Response – Phishing Attack

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an incident response process based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework following a phishing attack that led to credential compromise and unauthorized system access.

The investigation focuses on identifying the phishing activity, containing the incident, mitigating its impact, and implementing controls to prevent similar attacks in the future.

## Scenario Summary
A mid-sized e-commerce company experienced a phishing attack in which employees received fraudulent emails impersonating the IT department. At least one employee provided login credentials, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to internal systems and customer data.

## Framework Applied
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
  - Identify
  - Protect
  - Detect
  - Respond
  - Recover

## Key Actions Taken
- Investigated phishing emails reported by employees
- Identified compromised credentials and abnormal login activity
- Disabled affected user accounts and reset passwords
- Implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Strengthened password policies
- Improved employee security awareness training
- Deployed advanced email filtering controls

## Security Impact
This incident highlights the risk posed by social engineering attacks and the importance of layered defenses, including user awareness, strong authentication mechanisms, and proactive monitoring.

Applying MFA, improving detection capabilities, and training users significantly reduces the likelihood and impact of credential-based attacks.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Incident response using NIST CSF
- Phishing attack analysis
- Credential compromise investigation
- Account containment and recovery
- Security awareness and preventive controls
