# Incident Response Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework – Phishing Attack


## Incident Overview
A mid-sized e-commerce company experienced a security incident involving a phishing attack. Several employees received fraudulent emails impersonating the IT department and requesting credential verification. As a result, at least one employee’s login credentials were compromised, allowing unauthorized access to internal systems and customer data.

## 1. Identify
During the investigation, it was determined that several employees received fraudulent emails impersonating the IT department and requesting credential verification. At least one employee’s login credentials were compromised, which allowed unauthorized access to internal systems and customer data.

## 2. Protect
To protect the organization from future incidents, multi-factor authentication (MFA) was implemented and password policies were strengthened to enhance account security. Additionally, security awareness training was provided to employees to reduce the risk of phishing attacks, and advanced email filtering was implemented to prevent malicious or compromised emails from reaching users

## 3. Detect
Several employees reported receiving fraudulent emails, which were investigated and confirmed to be phishing attempts. Shortly after, abnormal login activity was detected, indicating unauthorized access to internal systems.

## 4. Respond
To mitigate the impact of the unauthorized access, the incident response team disabled the compromised accounts and reset affected user passwords. Relevant stakeholders were notified, and the unauthorized access was successfully contained.

## 5. Recover
Normal operations were restored after the compromised accounts were disabled and affected passwords were reset. Following the incident, the organization improved its security awareness training, with a stronger focus on phishing detection. Additional measures were implemented to reduce the risk of future phishing incidents and strengthen overall security resilience.
