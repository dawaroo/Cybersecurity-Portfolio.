# Network Security Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents a network security assessment of a hybrid enterprise environment supporting both on-premises infrastructure and cloud-based services.

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate network segmentation, traffic flow, security controls, and potential risks, and to provide recommendations to strengthen the organization’s overall network security posture.

## Environment Overview
The analyzed network supports:
- A public-facing e-commerce website hosted in a DMZ
- Internal business systems and customer databases
- On-site and remote employee access through secure connections

The network must maintain high availability for customer-facing services while protecting sensitive internal and customer data.

## Key Areas Analyzed
- Network zones and asset placement
- Traffic flow between internet, DMZ, and internal networks
- Network security controls (firewalls, IPS, VPN)
- Risks related to segmentation, monitoring, and exposure
- Defense-in-depth strategies

## Key Findings
- Improper segmentation may allow lateral movement from the DMZ to internal systems
- Limited traffic monitoring could result in undetected malicious activity
- Public-facing systems increase exposure to external threats
- Reliance on a single security perimeter increases risk

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network security analysis
- Traffic flow and segmentation design
- Risk identification and mitigation
- IDS/IPS and SIEM concepts
- Defense-in-depth strategy
