# SQL Security Analysis Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of SQL to investigate employee devices and login activity within an organization. The analysis focuses on retrieving, filtering, and correlating data from multiple database tables to identify outdated systems, unusual login behavior, and potential security risks.

The investigation was conducted using a MariaDB environment compatible with MySQL syntax and reflects common tasks performed by security analysts when reviewing system access and authentication activity.

## Investigation Objectives
The objectives of this investigation were to:
- Identify employee devices that require operating system updates
- Review login attempts for unusual or suspicious activity
- Analyze login behavior across different locations and time periods
- Correlate employee and login data using SQL joins

## Environment Overview
- Database system: MariaDB (MySQL-compatible)
- Database used: organization
- Tables analyzed:
  - machines
  - employees
  - log_in_attempts
- Access level: Read-only (no database modifications performed)

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL querying using SELECT and FROM
- Data filtering using WHERE, LIKE, AND, OR, and NOT
- Sorting results using ORDER BY
- Correlating data using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN
- Security-focused data analysis and investigation techniques

## Security Relevance
SQL-based investigations are a critical skill for security analysts. The ability to efficiently retrieve and analyze data from databases supports incident investigations, access reviews, compliance checks, and threat detection. This project demonstrates how structured queries can provide meaningful security insights without requiring administrative access.
